					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>Hello! I am Edward, a Software Engineer currently based in New York City.</p>
						
					<p>Throughout my career, I have enjoyed many experiences working in the IT industry. As a former IT Instructor at Per Scholas, 
						I helped prepare students from underrepresented communities for their first technical job. As a Technician at Google, I was 
						fortunate to work with some of the most talented Technicians and Engineers the world has to offer. However, as I continued 
						to progress in my career and learn new technologies, I decided to shift my area of focus to Full-Stack Web Development and 
						Software Engineering.</p>
						
					<p>As a Software Engineer, I enjoy applying my skills and knowledge of Full-Stack Web Development and Computer Science to build 
						attractive and dynamic user interfaces that enhance productivity and provide a better online presence for companies.</p>
							
					<p>When I am not working on a project, I use my spare time to learn more about popular libraries, frameworks, and other 
					programming languages.</p>
							
					<p>I am always excited to hear from former colleagues, managers or interesting creative people, so feel free to contact me if you 
					would like to connect.</p>

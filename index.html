				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>Hello! I am Edward, a Software Engineer currently based in New York City.</p>
				<p>Throughout my career, I have enjoyed many experiences working in the Information Technology industry. 
					As a former IT Instructor at Per Scholas, I helped prepare students from underrepresented communities 
					for their first technical job. As a Technician at Google, I was fortunate to work with some of the most 
					talented Technicians and Engineers the world has to offer. However, as I continued to progress in my 
					career and learn new technologies, I decided to shift my area of focus to Full-Stack Web Development and 
					Software Engineering.</p>
				<p>As a Software Engineer, I enjoy applying my skills and knowledge of Full-Stack Web Development and Computer 
					Science to build attractive and dynamic user interfaces that enhance productivity and provide a better online 
					presence for companies.</p>
				<p>When I am not working on a project, I use my spare time to learn more about popular libraries, frameworks, and 
					other programming languages.</p>
				<p>I am always excited to hear from former colleagues, managers or interesting creative people, so feel free to 
					contact me if you would like to connect.</p>

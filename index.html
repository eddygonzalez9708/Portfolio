			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Hello! I am Edward, a Software Engineer based in Florida.</p>
			<p>My journey in the technology industry has been both exciting and humbling. As a former Information
				Technology Instructor at Per Scholas, I had the privilege of helping students from underrepresented
				communities launch their careers. Working as a Technician at Astreya on Google's campus, I was immersed
				in a world of innovation alongside brilliant minds, igniting my passion for Software Engineering.</p>
			<p>As a Software Engineer with over 5 years of experience, I thrive on tackling complex challenges, building
				web applications, and streamlining operations through automation. I've witnessed firsthand how these
				efforts drive revenue
				growth and enhance productivity for businesses, ensuring their competitiveness in today's dynamic
				economy.</p>
			<p>Beyond coding, I cherish spending time with my family, cheering on the Yankees, salsa dancing, and diving
				into virtual adventures.</p>
			<p>I'm eager to reconnect with former colleagues, managers, or anyone who shares a passion for creativity.
				Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate on projects that blend technology
				with social impact.üåç</p>

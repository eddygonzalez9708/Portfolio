			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Hello! I am Edward, a Software Engineer based in Florida.</p>
			<p>I have had many exciting and humbling experiences throughout my career in the Technology industry. As a
				former Information Technology Instructor at Per Scholas, I helped prepare students from underrepresented
				communities to land their first job. As a Technician who worked for Astreya on Google's campus, I was
				fortunate to be surrounded by the brightest minds developing the latest innovations that would change
				the world forever. This experience inspired me greatly and made me shift my focus to Software
				Engineering.</p>
			<p>As a Software Engineer, I enjoy solving complex problems, creating web applications, and automating
				complex tasks to transform businesses. The results come in the form of increased revenue and
				productivity in the workplace, but most importantly, my skills have helped companies stay relevant and
				competitive in a fast-paced and always-changing economy.</p>
			<p>When I am not coding, I spend time with my family, watch the Yankees win, or compete in high-stakes games
				in the virtual world.</p>
			<p>I am always excited to hear from former colleagues, managers, or interesting creative people, so feel
				free to contact me if you would like to connect or grab a üç∫ if you would like to talk some shop!</p>
